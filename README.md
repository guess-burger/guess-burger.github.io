# Guess-Burger

Here's a selection of random things I've made:

[Sh√ºpping List](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guess_burger.shopping_list) - A React-Native app written in ClojureScript born out of my frustations with existing shopping list apps

[Wavelength](https://mysterious-basin-71031.herokuapp.com/) - [src](https://github.com/guess-burger/wavelength) - A online, multiplayer version of the fantastic [boardgame of the same name](https://www.wavelength.zone/)

[Mandelbrot-cljs](http://guess-burger.github.io/mandelbrot-cljs/) - [src](https://github.com/guess-burger/mandelbrot-cljs) - A naive Mandlebrot demonstration allowing "click to zoom" exploration

[Time Sheets](http://guess-burger.github.io/timesheets/) - A simple tool for making time tracking and time sheets easierwrittern in ClojureScript.

[Time Tracker](http://guess-burger.github.io/time-tracker/time-tracker.html) - [src](https://github.com/guess-burger/elm-time) - An earlier, less complete attempt at making timesheets easier, written in Elm
