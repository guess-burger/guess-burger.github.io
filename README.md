# Guess-Burger

Here's a selection of random things I've made:

[Time Tracker](http://guess-burger.github.io/time-tracker/time-tracker.html) - [src](https://github.com/guess-burger/elm-time) - A simple tool to make time sheet easier written in Elm

[Mandelbrot-cljs](http://guess-burger.github.io/mandelbrot-cljs/) - [src](https://github.com/guess-burger/mandelbrot-cljs) - A naive Mandlebrot demonstration allowing "click to zoom" exploration

[Sh√ºpping List](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guess_burger.shopping_list) - A React-Native app written in ClojureScript born out of my frustations with existing shopping list apps
